# About Me

I am a senior undergraduate at IIT Delhi, with a deep interest in Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction. I aim to design autonomus agents with cognitive capabilities that can interact with humans naturally. I want to apply my knowledge of Robotics and AI in conjunction with Human Ergonomics to design robots which can co-exist with humans. I am also passionate about traveling, trekking, sports and country music.
