# About Me

I am a senior undergraduate at IIT Delhi, with a deep interest in Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction and Computer Vision. I aim to design autonomous agents with cognitive capabilities that can interact with humans naturally. I want to apply my knowledge of Robotics and AI in conjunction with Human Ergonomics to design robots which can co-exist with humans. I am particularly interested in the problems of Human-Robot Interaction Design, Autonomous Driving and Robot Learning from Demonstration.

I have had the good fortune of working with many amazing HRI researchers including Prof. Holly Yanco and Prof. Mary-Anne Williams.

Outside of work, I am quite passionate about hiking and sports.
