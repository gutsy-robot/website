#summary = "Starting this project in Spring, 18, working with Aniket Bajpai, a senior undergraduate in CSE, IITD. Our aim is to work on planning algorithms for co-ordinated navigation of a drone swarm in disaster stricken regions for search and rescue purposes. We also want to leverage human decision making capabilities in these situations, so we will work on understanding how a drone swarm can be controlled and coordinated by one human supervisor. More specifically, we want to create an interface by which a human can supervise an autonomous drone swarm, and intervene whenever he feels necessary. We plan to design a VR interface using a HTC Vive to create the human-interface. "
