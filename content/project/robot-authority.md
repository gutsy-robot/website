The project was based on designing social behaviours for robots in position of authority. A test case of a PR2 robot working as a security guard was used to conduct Human-Robot Interaction experiments. The aim was to identify and analyse the factors that affect human obedience and trust in interactions with robots in a position of authority. I conducted multiple HRI experiments for this project using a PR2 robot with different robot behaviours and then tried to investigate how different participants' perception of the robot's behaviour affected their willingness to follow the robot's instructions

Social Robots are of great utility in healthcare, search and rescue, surveillance and military applications. In many applications, these robots instruct/advice humans to follow their instructions. In this paper we present the results of a HRI experiment conducted to explore the variables involved in obedience of humans to social robots. We were mainly interested in studying how obedience to robot is related to perceived aggression in robot’s behaviour. We implemented various social cues to exhibit and convey authority and aggressiveness in the robot’s behaviour. We analysed the impact of other factors such as perceived anthropomorphism, safety, intelligence and responsibility in robot’s behaviour on participants’ compliance to the robot’s instructions. The results suggest that the degree of aggression that different participants perceived in the robot’s behaviour did not have a significant impact in their decision to follow the robot’s instruction. We have provided possible explanations for our findings and identified new research questions that need to be answered in this field of research.

Some video demonstrations related to the experiment are given below.
