abstract =  "There has been much debate, sci-fi movie scenes, and several scientific studies exploring the concept of robot authority. In this paper, we describe the results of a Human-Robot Interaction Study that we conducted to identify the factors that affect human obedience to robots. We set up a robot in a publicly #accessible building to act as a security guard that issued instructions to specific humans."
