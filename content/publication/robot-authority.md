#"There has been much debate, sci-fi movie scenes, and several scientific studies exploring the concept of robot authority. Some of the key research questions #include: #when should humans follow/question robot instructions; how can a robot increase its ability to convince humans to follow their instructions or to change their #behaviour#. In this paper, we describe a recent experiment designed to explore the notions of robot authority and human obedience. We set up a robot in a publicly #accessible building to act as a security guard that issued instructions to specific humans. We identified and analysed the factors that affected a human's decisions to #follow the robot's instruction. The four key factors were: perceived aggression, responsiveness, anthropomorphism, level of safety and intelligence in the robot's #behaviour. We implemented various social cues to exhibit and convey authority and aggressiveness in the robot's behaviour. The results suggest that the degree of #aggression that different people perceived in the robot's behaviour did not have a significant impact in their decision to follow the robot's instruction. Although, the #people who disobeyed the robot, perceived the robot's behaviour to be more unsafe and less human-like than the people who followed the robot's instructions and also #found the robot to be more responsive."
